# ML Zoomcamp 2023 â€“ Second Capstone Project

This computer vision project aims to build a convolutional neural network for classification of 10 different dog breeds. The original dataset can be retrieved from the [ImageNet Dogs Dataset for Fine-grained Visual Categorization](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs "http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs") from the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL)](https://svl.stanford.edu/ "https://svl.stanford.edu/"). As mentioned on the thew website, the Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. The dataset can also be found on Kaggle at [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset/ "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset/").
