The _Heart failure clinical records_ dataset contains the medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period, where each patient profile has 13 clinical features.

The research article based on the data set states that a random forest model is the best model that can predict survival of patients with heart failure from the serum creatinine and ejection fraction features alone. The research article can be accessed at the link, [Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Machine-learning-can-predict-survival-of-patients-Chicco-Jurman/e64579d8593140396b518682bb3a47ba246684eb) (link to pdf of article [here](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5.pdf)).

The data set can be retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at the link, [Heart failure clinical records](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records).

The data analysis is organized as follows:

* `notebook.ipynb`, which contains:
    * Data preparation and data clearning,
    * Exploratory data analysis, feature importance analysis,
    * Model selection process and parameter tuning.

* `train.py`
